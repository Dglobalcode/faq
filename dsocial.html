                                    <p>When the client sends a request that the server cannot understand, the 400 error
                                        appears. This usually happens when the data sent by the browser does not comply
                                        with the standards of the HTTP protocol. Thus, the server does not know how to
                                        process a request that contains an incorrect syntax.When you see a 400 error
                                        page, it is likely that there is some kind of unstable client component such as
                                        an operating system that is not sufficiently protected, a faulty browser or a
                                        cache problem. So it's a good idea to run some tests on your computer before
                                        contacting a website administrator about such an error.
                                        The tests you can do is try to open the page in a different browser or check if
                                        your operating system has all the important updates installed. If you get this
                                        type of error when entering different websites, it is likely that your computer
                                        needs a security review.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>If the client has requested a web page that is protected by a password, the
                                        server returns the 401 error. In this case, the error is not returned in a
                                        typical way, but a pop-up window appears in which the user is asked to enter a
                                        password to access the website. If you have the password, you can view the
                                        website without problems. If you do not enter a password you will be directed to
                                        the page that indicates the error. In this case, it is not a possible failure of
                                        your computer or anything like that. It is simply that the webmaster has decided
                                        to protect all or part of his website from unauthorized access by means of a
                                        password.

                                    <p>404 is one of the most popular http states and it is quite likely that you have
                                        encountered this type of error at some time. This code indicates that the server
                                        has not found anything at the location specified by the client, either because
                                        the URL has not been entered correctly or the structure of permanent URLs (also
                                        known as permalinks) has been modified in such a way that all links they have
                                        been moved to different locations.
                                        In certain cases, the 404 error can also occur when a site has recently been
                                        moved to another server and the DNS points to the old location. But this is a
                                        problem that needs to be given a little time to fix.
                                        Although on certain occasions it is impossible to avoid this error, it is
                                        advisable to optimize this page on your website and activate the automatic
                                        redirection in case you have modified the permanent links on the site.
